      If you know me you would have known that I started learning about the web without having gone through any
      computing courses in university previously. I didnâ€™t dare to venture into server-side programming for a long time
      because of my background.

      I remember when I eventually picked up the courage to try, I had such a hard time understanding the documentations
      for Express, MongDB and Node that I gave up.
